# Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas - New York City Education and Crime Patterns

### Alexandra Drossos, Hassan Saad, Karina Tasng

The goal of this project was to use Pandas, Matplotlib, and other python libraries to conduct exploratory data analysis in order to derive some correlation between high school graduation rates and police involved shooting in New York City. To do that, we set out to answer the following questions (in the which the numbering below corresponds to a specific Jupyter notebook in the main project folder):

1. What is the overall trend of police involved shootings year over year in New York City?
2. What is the profile of perpetrators in police involved shootings in New York City?
3. What the overall trend of graduation rate year over year has been in New York City by gender?
4. What relationship do graduation rate and dropout rate have on shooting incident rates?
5. How does the high school dropout rate compare to median household income, aggregated across each of the 62 counties in the state of New York?
6. How does the shootings rate per 1000 citizens compare to median household income, aggregated across each of the 5 boroughs in the city of New York?

Alongside the code corresponding to the EDA for each of these questions, we've included our final report with findings and conclusion.
